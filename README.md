# Week-three-GMNO 

# What to do what to do 

This week, we built a to-do list app. It allows a users to create, complete and delete tasks from a list, and be responsive for as many users as possible. 

We also learnt how to make automated tests covering our main user stories. 

## User stories

### Core

As a busy person, I want to:

- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

- Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

- Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

- Use all the features of the app without a mouse

### Stretch

- As a busy person, I want to:
Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what's left to do


### Acceptance Criteria

A working to-do list
Tests for (at least) each user story
A responsive, mobile-first design
Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
